# Food Delivery Time Prediction

## Objective
 The goal is to predict food delivery times based on customer location, restaurant location, weather, traffic, and other factors. This involves both data preprocessing and building predictive models using linear regression and logistic regression.

### Phase 1: Data Collection and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Step 1 - Data Import and Preprocessing
**Dataset** 
 Load the dataset [Food_Delivery_Time_Prediction.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gAJGXBob3zRpJkRWQhvf3a94PS6NhGjx/view?usp=sharing).


**Handle Missing Values**
 Check for any missing or inconsistent values in columns such as Distance, Delivery_Time, etc. and decide how to handle them, either through imputation or deletion.

**Data Transformation**
1. Encode Categorical Variables: Use one-hot encoding or label encoding for variables like Weather Conditions, Traffic Conditions, Vehicle Type.
2. Normalize/Standardize Numeric Columns: Normalize or standardize continuous features like Distance, Delivery_sTime, and Order_Cost for consistency.

#### Step 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Descriptive Statistics**
Calculate the basic statistics for numerical features such as mean, median, mode, and variance.

**Correlation Analysis**
Visualize correlations between features and the target variable (Delivery_Time) to identify the most relevant predictors.

**Outlier Detection**
Detect outliers in numerical features using boxplots and handle them appropriately.


#### Step 3 - Feature Engineering
**Distance Calculation**
If the dataset doesn't contain an actual distance metric, calculate the distance between the customer and restaurant using latitudes and longitudes (Haversine formula).

**Time-Based Features**
Create new features related to the time of day, such as Rush Hour vs Non-Rush Hour, to improve predictions.


### Phase 2: Predictive Modeling

#### Step 4 - Linear Regression Model
**Train-Test Split**
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).

**Model Building**
Use Linear Regression to predict the Delivery Time based on features like Distance, Traffic_Conditions, and Order_Priority.

**Evaluation Metrics**
 Evaluate the model using:
1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
2. R-squared (RÂ²)
3. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

#### Step 5 - Logistic Regression Model (for Categorization)
**Model Objective**
 Classify deliveries as "Fast" or "Delayed" based on binary features such as Traffic, Weather, Delivery_Person_Experience, etc.

**Model Implementation**
 Use Logistic Regression to predict the delivery status.

**Evaluation Metrics**
 Evaluate using metrics such as:

1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1-score
5. Confusion Matrix

### Phase 3: Reporting and Insights

#### Step 6 - Model Evaluation and Comparison
* Compare the Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models based on their performance (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix).
* Visualize the results using confusion matrices and ROC curves.


#### Step 7 - Actionable Insights
* Based on model predictions, suggest operational improvements such as:
    * Optimizing delivery routes.
    * Adjusting staffing during high-traffic periods.
    * Providing better training to delivery staff
