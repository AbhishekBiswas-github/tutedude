# 🌍 Global Pollution Analysis and Energy Recovery

## 🎯 Objective
The goal is to analyze global pollution data and develop strategies for pollution reduction and converting pollutants into energy. The dataset will be used for both data preprocessing and building regression models to predict energy recovery from pollution levels.

## 📊 Phase 1: Data Collection and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Step 1: Data Import and Preprocessing

- **Datasets**
  - Load the dataset [`Global_Pollution_Analysis.csv`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AEMcCWzJ24fc26Q761SEOa1sOsZiJBC5/view)

- **Handle Missing Values**
  - Identify and impute missing or inconsistent data using appropriate strategies.

- **Data Transformation**
  - Normalize or scale pollution indices (air, water, and soil).
  - Encode categorical features like `Country` and `Year` using label or one-hot encoding.

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Descriptive Statistics**
  - Calculate statistics for numerical features like `CO2_Emissions` and `Industrial_Waste_in_tons`.

- **Correlation Analysis**
  - Visualize correlations between pollution levels and energy consumption using heatmaps.

- **Visualizations**
  - Create bar charts, line plots, and box plots to explore trends across time and countries.

### Step 3: Feature Engineering

- **Yearly Trends**
  - Extract year-based trends to examine changes in pollution and energy recovery over time.

- **Energy Consumption per Capita**
  - Derive energy consumption per capita for more granular analysis.

## 🤖 Phase 2: Predictive Modeling

### Step 4: Linear Regression Model (for Pollution Prediction)

- **Model Objective**
  - Predict energy recovery (in GWh) from pollution levels and industrial waste.

- **Model Building**
  - Use features like `Air_Pollution_Index`, `CO2_Emissions`, and `Industrial_Waste_in_tons` to train a Linear Regression model.

- **Evaluation Metrics**
  - R² (R-squared)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

### Step 5: Logistic Regression Model (for Categorizing Pollution Levels)

- **Model Objective**
  - Classify countries into pollution severity levels: Low, Medium, High.

- **Model Implementation**
  - Use Logistic Regression with features like `Air_Pollution_Index` and `CO2_Emissions`.

- **Evaluation Metrics**
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Phase 3: Reporting and Insights

### Step 6: Model Evaluation and Comparison

- Compare Linear and Logistic Regression models using performance metrics.
- Visualize performance using classification reports and confusion matrices.

### Step 7: Actionable Insights

- Insights into how pollution levels influence energy recovery.
- Identify countries that can benefit from pollution control measures.
- Recommend strategies for reducing pollution and improving energy conversion.
